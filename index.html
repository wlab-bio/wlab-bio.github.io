    <p class="intro"><span class="highlight">U</span>nanticipated technologies can blossom from seemingly unrelated developments. Solid-state quantum theory gave us the transistor; the economics of video-gaming gave us scaling in GPU production which, in turn, precipitated the achievability of modern AI. In 2019, we demonstrated the capacity for the newest generation of DNA sequencing methods to do something qualitatively similar for the way we probe living systems.</p>

    <div class="example">
        <h2>A Simple Example</h2>
        <p>Let's say that you want to map the locations of every person on the surface of the earth. There are two ways you can imagine approaching this problem:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>You can send up a satellite around the earth and take photographs.</li>
            <li>You can look at the Bluetooth pings between individuals' mobile phones. If you record enough of those pings, you can reconstruct everyone's relative positions without prior knowledge (or a map).</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <h2>What is DNA Microscopy?</h2>
    <p><span class="highlight">DNA microscopy</span> achieves this for biomolecules, instead of people. In short, in DNA microscopy, rather than using a large apparatus to zero-in on specific locations within the sample, we deploy a massive mix of random, artificial DNA molecules, that give each biomolecule its own unique molecular identity (a molecular IP address).</p>

    <p>We then turn these molecules into a massive intercommunicating network that goes to work encoding molecular proximities across the specimen (in cells or tissue) into brand new DNA sequences. Reading these proximities out by high-throughput DNA sequencing, and applying advances in numerical computing, we can infer an image of the original sample (similar to the mobile phone positions in the original example).</p>

    <h2>Our Progress</h2>
    <p>In 2019, we demonstrated this for the first time in two-dimensions:</p>

    <p>And we are now applying this in three-dimensions to whole, intact organisms:</p>
